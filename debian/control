Description: distribution-independent installer framework
 Calamares is a distribution-independent installer framework.
 .
 It provides a graphical installer that can be used with nearly
 any distribution. This package is suitable for live media on
 Debian-based systems, and won't be of any particular use on
 and already installed system.
 .
 You will likely want to provide your own config files to match
 your distribution, reading the Calamares documentation will guide
 you through that process.
