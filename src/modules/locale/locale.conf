# This settings are used to set your default system time zone.
# Time zones are usually located under /usr/share/zoneinfo and
# provided by the 'tzdata' package of your Distribution.
#
# Distributions using systemd can list available
# time zones by using the timedatectl command.
#    timedatectl list-timezones
#
# The starting timezone (e.g. the pin-on-the-map) when entering
# the locale page can be set through keys *region* and *zone*.
# If either is not set, defaults to America/New_York.
#
region:                     "America"
zone:                       "New_York"


# System locales are detected in the following order:
#
#  - /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
#  - localeGenPath (defaults to /etc/locale.gen if not set)
#  - 'locale -a' output
#
# Enable only when your Distribution is using an
# custom path for locale.gen
#localeGenPath:             "PATH_TO/locale.gen"

# GeoIP based Language settings:
#
# GeoIP need an working Internet connection.
# This can be managed from `welcome.conf` by adding
# internet to the list of required conditions.
#
# Leave commented out to disable GeoIP.
#
# An HTTP request is made to *geoipUrl* -- depending on the geoipStyle,
# the URL may be modified before use. The request should return
# valid data in a suitable format, depending on geoipStyle;
# generally this includes a string value with the timezone
# in <region>/<zone> format.
#
# Note that this example URL works, but the service is shutting
# down in June 2018.
#
# Suitable JSON data looks like
# ```
#    {"time_zone":"America/New_York"}
# ```
# Suitable XML data looks like
# ```
#    <Response><TimeZone>Europe/Brussels</TimeZone></Response>
# ```
#
#geoipUrl:                  "freegeoip.net"

# GeoIP style. Leave commented out for the "legacy" interpretation.
# This setting only makes sense if geoipUrl is set, enabliing geoIP.
#
# Possible values are:
#   unset       same as "legacy"
#   blank       same as "legacy"
#   "legacy"    appends "/json" to geoipUrl, above, and uses JSON format
#               (which is what freegeoip.net provides there).
#   "json"      URL is not modified, uses JSON format.
#   "xml"       URL is not modified, uses XML format.
#
# The JSON format is provided by freegeoip.net, but that service is
# shutting down in June 2018. There are other providers with the same
# format. XML format is provided for Ubiquity.
#geoipStyle:    "legacy"
