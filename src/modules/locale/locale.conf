# This settings are used to set your default system time zone.
# Time zones are usually located under /usr/share/zoneinfo and
# provided by the 'tzdata' package of your Distribution.
#
# Distributions using systemd can list available
# time zones by using the timedatectl command.
#    timedatectl list-timezones
#
# The starting timezone (e.g. the pin-on-the-map) when entering
# the locale page can be set through keys *region* and *zone*.
# If either is not set, defaults to America/New_York.
#
region:                     "America"
zone:                       "New_York"


# System locales are detected in the following order:
#
#  - /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
#  - localeGenPath (defaults to /etc/locale.gen if not set)
#  - 'locale -a' output
#
# Enable only when your Distribution is using an
# custom path for locale.gen
#localeGenPath:             "PATH_TO/locale.gen"

# GeoIP based Language settings:
#
# GeoIP need an working Internet connection.
# This can be managed from `welcome.conf` by adding
# internet to the list of required conditions.
#
# Leave commented out to disable GeoIP.
#
# An HTTP request is made to http://*geoipUrl*/json (which just happens
# to be the GET path needed by freegeoip.net, so calling this a URL
# is a stretch). The request must return valid JSON data; there should
# be an attribute *time_zone*, with a string value set to the
# timezone, in <region>/<zone> form.
#
# Suitable data looks like
# ```
#    {"time_zone":"America/New_York"}
# ```
#
#geoipUrl:                  "freegeoip.net"
