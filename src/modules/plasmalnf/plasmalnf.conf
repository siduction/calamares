# The Plasma Look-and-Feel module allows selecting a Plasma
# Look-and-Feel in the live- or host-system and switches the
# host Plasma session immediately to the chosen LnF; it
# can also write a LnF configuration to the target user / on
# the target system.
#
# This module should be used once in a view section (to get
# the UI) and once in the exec section (to apply the selection
# to the target user). It should come **after** the user module
# in exec, so that the target user has been created alrady.
---
# Full path to the Plasma look-and-feel tool (CLI program
# for querying and applying Plasma themes). If this is not
# set, no LNF setting will happen.
lnftool:	"/usr/bin/lookandfeeltool"

# For systems where the user Calamares runs as (usually root,
# via either sudo or pkexec) has a clean environment, set this
# to the originating username; the lnftool will be run through
# "sudo -H -u <liveuser>" instead of directly.

# You can limit the list of Plasma look-and-feel themes by listing ids
# here. If this key is not present, all of the installed themes are listed.
# If the key is present, only installed themes that are *also* included
# in the list are shown (could be none!).
#
# Themes may be listed by id, (e.g. fluffy-bunny, below) or as a theme
# and an image (e.g. breeze) which will be used to show a screenshot.
# Themes with no image get a "missing screenshot" image; if the
# image file is not found, they get a color swatch based on the image name.
